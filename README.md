# Project_Build_a_ML_Workflow_For_Scones_Unlimited_On_Amazon_SageMaker
Image Classifiers were used in the field of computer vision to identify the content of an image and have been used across a broad variety of industries, from advanced technologies like autonomous vehicles and augmented reality, to eCommerce platforms, and even in diagnostic medicine.

Hired as a Machine Learning Engineer for a scone-delivery-focused logistics company, Scones Unlimited, the individual was tasked with shipping an Image Classification model. The image classification model could have helped the team in a variety of ways in their operating environment: detecting people and vehicles in video feeds from roadways, better supporting routing for their engagement on social media, detecting defects in their scones, and many more!

In that project, the task was to build an image classification model that could automatically detect which kind of vehicle delivery drivers have, in order to route them to the correct loading bay and orders. Assigning delivery professionals who had a bicycle to nearby orders and giving motorcyclists orders that were farther could have helped Scones Unlimited optimize their operations.

As an MLE, the goal was to ship a scalable and safe model. Once the model became available to other teams on-demand, it was important that the model could scale to meet demand, and that safeguards were in place to monitor and control for drift or degraded performance.

In that project, AWS Sagemaker was used to build an image classification model that could tell bicycles apart from motorcycles. The model was deployed, AWS Lambda functions were used to build supporting services, and AWS Step Functions were employed to compose the model and services into an event-driven application. By the end of that project, a portfolio-ready demo had been created that showcased the ability to build and compose scalable, ML-enabled, AWS applications.
